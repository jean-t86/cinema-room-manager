## Description

This project is from JetBrains' Academy Kotlin's track. It is a console application that helps with the 
management of cinema rooms. 

## General information

Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live 
through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, 
you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales 
statistics, and more.
